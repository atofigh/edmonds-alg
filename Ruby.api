Message: AADSTS50020: User account 'AlejandroGlez2021@outlook.com' from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant 'Microsoft Services' and cannot access the application '80ccca67-54bd-44ab-8625-4b79c4dc7775'(Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
